2. The author�s attitude to the old lady in paragraph one is

A. condescending 
B. intolerant 
C. objective 
D. sardonic 
E. supportive

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:

The author refers to the old lady as �the dear old lady�, and yet he is disapproving of her behavior. 
He is assuming a tone of superiority and hence is best described as �condescending�. 
(Sardonic is mocking, or scornful, and is too strong for this case. Intolerant is not quite 
right because he is more pointing out the fault in her attitude than showing a lack of tolerance for her as a person.)
