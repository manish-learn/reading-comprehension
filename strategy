1. Preview the text and headings to get the context
2. Write your goals, what you want to achieve, after reading the text. 
3. Be mindful and concentrate while reading. Concept of regression, where if you are not mindful enough, your mind tend to wander off.
4. Read in chunks, rather then reading 1 word at a time read 3 to 5 words at the same time. Don't subvocalize the words in your head as it
   will make your reading slow.
5. Don't read the whole thing, only the stuff which you would like to know.
6. Time your reads to make sure you are able to comprehend in the specific time.
7. After reading summarize the information in your own words to make sure your goals are achieved.
